  <em><strong>Rod Saboury's 1967 Corvette Convertible Is The Latest In A Distinguished Line Of Pro-Style Vettes.</strong></em><br />

    <td valign="top"><p>      In the annals of Pro Street history, few car builders have    the name recognition-or staying power-of Maryland's Rod Saboury. To    impressionable youth (this author included) who watched the Pro Street    movement ramp up before they were old enough to drive, Rod was to Car Craft    and Popular Hot Rodding what Wilt Chamberlain was to Sports Illustrated. Indeed, Rod has a long history of feature stories in    VETTE, too, including a memorable 1992 cover shot in which his wife, Martina,    appeared. (That's her, still looking memorable, in the accompanying photos.)    He made his name by carving up Corvettes into influential hot rods-and he    didn't particularly care if the purists got their fiberglass noses tweaked    because of it.</p>

          <td width="781">Such    was the case about 20 years ago, when Rod used a concours-quality    split-window '63 Vette as the starting point for a stunning creation. The car    had a supercharger that stretched to the roofline, was stuffed with some of    the biggest tires found on a car with a license plate, and wore the    multicolor graphics typical of the mid-'80s. Reaction to it was divided into    two camps: &quot;Wow, that's impressive&quot; and &quot;Wow, how could you    cut up that classic?&quot;</td>

        <br />
        Since then, Rod's M.O. has been the same: locate a    Corvette, envision the untapped Pro Street form inside, and break out the    Sawzall. The latest of these projects is this crimson-colored '67 roadster.    Compared with his wild creations of the '80s and early '90s, the low-slung    Vette, with its mostly stock appearance and blood red paint, looks downright    subtle. Of course, with wheel tubs filling what was once the car's meager    storage space and the sound from a 502-inch big-block, it doesn't fool the    uninitiated for very long.<br />
        <br />
        Interestingly, this car represents the first convertible    Rod has ever built. &quot;I've done many Pro Street Corvettes, but they've    all been coupes,&quot; he says. &quot;I always wanted to do a big-block '67    roadster.&quot;<br />
        <br />
        Unlike some of his other project cars, this one didn't    start out as a pristine original. In fact, it had been used as a drag car    throughout the '70s and even wore a gold-leaf paint job. Referring to the    car's condition and appearance, Rod says the Vette &quot;wasn't pretty&quot;    when he acquired it.<br />
        Despite its pro-style appearance, the car is pretty stock    forward of the rear suspension. Rod also wanted to preserve the classic    top-down look of the Vette and not disturb it with a rollcage, so the chassis    was beefed up to compensate. Heavy-gauge steel was used for the tubs and rear    floor section, all of which was tied together with extensive welding. This    bolstered the strength and rigidity of the car sufficiently to eliminate the    need for the 'cage.<br />
        <br />
        <a href="vemp_0601_07_z+1967_corvette_convertible+saboury.jpg" title="'1967 Corvette Convertible Saboury ' "><img border="0" width="140" height="105" src="clip_image006.jpg" alt="Description: 1967 Corvette Convertible Saboury " /></a><br />
        <br />
        In accordance with the Pro Street ethic, the stock    independent rearend was ditched in favor of a narrowed 9-inch, which is    located with a custom four-link/coilover setup. It's stuffed with 4.10 gears    and spins 33x21.5-inch rear tires. Up front, custom tubular A-arms hold up    the Weld Aluma Star wheels. Wilwood disc brakes are used at all corners.<br />
        <br />
        Apart from the stretched rear wheel openings, the body of    the car is essentially stock, including the Stinger hood. There are no    protruding carburetors or Pro Stock hoodscoops-it's all Vette. The Corvette    Corner, in nearby Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania, applied the Viper Red paint    and black Stinger accent.<br />
        The interior is pretty stock-looking, too, including    factory gauges and upholstery. One of the car's best details is the vinyl    covering on the wheel tubs, which perfectly matches the upholstery of the    stock seats. It's a nice touch and certainly shows Rod is in tune with    classic Corvettes. One of the cabin's few deviations from stock is a Hurst    shifter, but even it looks like a factory-fit part.<br />

        No Corvette connoisseur, however, would ever mistake the    ZZ502 crate engine under the hood for a factory-installed option. The    big-inch, roller-type big-block is rated at 502 hp and 567 gut-wrenching    lb-ft of torque. It's fitted with aluminum oval-port heads, an aluminum    dual-plane intake, and a Holley 850-cfm four-barrel. With 9.6:1 compression    and an HEI ignition, it's a streetable, pump-gas-friendly combination that    has no trouble spinning those big rear treads.</p>
      <p>Ceramic-coated &quot;block hugger&quot; headers from    Sanderson send away the exhaust through large-diameter outlets that help    create a soul-stirring sound at idle. The engine is backed up by a Super T10    four-speed transmission. The bulletproof powertrain and relatively simple    chassis mods help make the car an easy cruiser, which has been part of Rod's    philosophy from the very start. &quot;I always build my cars to be    driven,&quot; he says. &quot;This one is no exception-you could drive it    across the country.&quot;<br />

        <br />
        By the way, Rod is also working on another Corvette    project. It's another '63 split-window car, which he intends to be what he    calls &quot;the first real 6-second/200-mph street car.&quot; The progress of    this ambitious project can be followed online at www.competitionplus.com.<br />
        If anyone could pull off such a feat, it's Rod Saboury-one    of the pioneers of Pro Street.</p>
