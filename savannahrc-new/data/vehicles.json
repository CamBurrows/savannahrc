      "description": "This is the car that got me back into the car hobby after 10 years of being away from the hobby. This car has a great story.In 1996 I heard about this car from another car guy at a show and I decided to track it down.My main reason was that most Camaro convertibles were small blocks or 6 cylinders and this car is an L78 396 Big Block with 375 horsepower! My only tip to find this car was that the owner was a police officer and I was given his name and the name of the city he worked at as a police officer. After some detective work I tracked him down and found out the car had been in his family since new. After a lot of haggling I bought the car which was partly disassembled and in horrible condition and did not run. We nicknamed him “Rusty “ because he was a bucket of rust. I hired a well known Camaro restoration Shop “Jen Jacs “ to do a body off restoration on the car . It took 1 year to do the resto back to 100% original condition. After some tweaking the car turned out fantastic and the car rides beautifully. It has a personalized tag that says what the car is SSRSL78.",

The motor is a true 1969 Corvette 427 L72 motor which is the motor Yenko used on all 39 69 Yenko Novas he built. Not all these Novas are accounted for so the possibility exists that this car is a real deal 69 Yenko Nova.  This car had the correct motor , American Racing Wheels, Lakewood traction bars and Sun tach and gauges. I did sell the American wheels ( I regret that now ) and replaced them with new wheels. This car could be my best find ever if it is proven to be one of the lost 69 Yenko Novas. The personalized tag on this car reads YENKOSC. The SC stands for “Super Car“. ",
